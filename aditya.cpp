/*

    Q1.  Why do we store Passenger objects as pointers in the TicketReservationSystem class?
    Ans. Pointers make it possible for Passenger objects to have dynamic memory allocation, 
         which improves program efficiency by preventing needless copies and managing their 
         lifespan.
    
    q2.  How does the searchByTicketNumber() function work?
    Ans. It iterates over the passengers to see if the ticket number of any of them corresponds 
         to the one you're seeking. The passenger is returned if a match is found; if not, nullptr 
         is returned.
    
    Q3.  What would happen if we didnâ€™t use an array of pointers to manage the passengers?
    Ans. Passenger objects would be copied into the vector in the absence of pointers, which 
         would result in inefficiencies and possible memory management problems, such as 
         unintentional object deletion.
